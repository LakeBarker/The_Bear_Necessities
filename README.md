# The_Bear_Necessities

# Overview
  The_Bear_Necessities (Bear_Necessity if that's a problem name) is going to be a website that will be dedicated to my dog, Bear! The idea is to have a site which is similar to a blog, with a timeline and events that can be updated and created. As Bears' owners, my Fiance and I will have the ability to create events, and others will be able to view it and make comments and the like. I'm seeing it as eventually being similar to a blog.
  
# Technologies Used
1. HTML
2. Python
3. Django
4. Express

# User Stories
As an owner, I want to...
1. sign in
2. Create the timeline
3. Add events
4. Events will have:
  1. A title
  2. a description/story
  3. a picture
  4. comments section
5. update events
6. delete events
7. respond to comments

As a viewer I want to...

# Stretch Goals!
